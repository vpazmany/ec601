Mission Statement: 

As a small coffee shop, we need to determine what coffee consumers are enjoying in the area to determine which products must be on our menu.

User Stories: 

I, the coffee shop, want immediate feedback based on handle and hashtag inputs to gage audience sentiment feedback about specific drinks to determine what to put on my own menu.

I, the coffee shop, want a percentage of the positive vs. negative sentiment in the text of the hashtag/handle searched to assess the reviews and fully understand the publicâ€™s sentiment.

I, the coffee shop, need to quickly filter and search tweets from specific popular coffee shops in the area.
